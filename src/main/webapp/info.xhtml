		<h3>About the System</h3>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/natanjava/JSF-bootfaces" target="_blank">This system (version 2.0)</a> registers users, 
		   launches and companies.</p> 
		<p>
		Each logged in user has different privileges. Each new user registered in the system can log in with username/password.
		Those who have privileges to register new launches need to say which partner company will be associated whenever a new
		launch is registered. 
		The launch will be analyzed by an administrator. If the launch is rejected, the ADMINISTRATOR must explain why. 
		And when there is new launch that have not been analyzed, a warning message will appear whenever an ADMINISTRATOR accesses 
		the first page of the system.
		</p>
		
		<p><u>ADMINISTRATOR</u> has access to all parts of the system:
  			 User, Launch, Company, Review and Reports pages, in terms of insertion, update and deletion.<br/>  
		   <u>MANAGER</u> can: Insert Launches. Once an ADMINISTRATOR approves/rejects a launch, 
		    MANAGER can no longer edit or delete it.<br/>
		   <u>ASSISTENT</u> can: Insert, edit and delete Partner Companies.<br/>
		   <u>ALL USERS</u> can: acess the list of users, launches and partner companies that have been saved 
		     in the system. Generate reports on users, launches and companies.<br/>
