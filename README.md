About the System
This model system registers users, and entries made by each user. Registration forms have validations. After logging in, a list of users already saved in the system is loaded. 
Each user can log into the system using their login and password, but only users with Administrator privileges can delete and edit. On the Lauch page, releases can be registered for 
the logged in user. There are report generation pages for launch and for the user, in which itÂ´s possible to search for results through filters or not and generate a PDF report.

Tolls - Technical Information: Eclipse IDE, Postgresql, Java Server Faces, Hibernate, BootFaces.
