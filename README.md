About the System.
This model system registers users, and entries made by each user. Registration forms have validations. After logging in, 
a list of users already saved in the system is loaded. Each user can log into the system using their own login and password, 
but only users with Administrator privileges can delete and update other registers. On the Lauch page, caunches can be registered 
for the logged user at the moment. There are report generation pages for launch and for the user, in which itÂ´s possible to search for 
results through filters or not and generate a PDF report.
